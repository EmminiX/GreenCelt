# Local Font Files

This directory contains local copies of the Lexend font to avoid network dependencies during Docker builds.

## Font Information
- Font: Lexend
- Website: https://www.lexend.com/
- License: Open Font License (OFL)

The font files are stored locally to ensure Docker builds don't fail when network connectivity to Google Fonts is limited or unavailable.

## Important Note
You need to replace these placeholder files with actual Lexend font files. You can download them from Google Fonts or from the official Lexend website.
